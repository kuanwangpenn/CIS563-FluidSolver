how to use:
-open main.html in your browser.
-use decent browsers which supports javascript, like chrome or firefox
-camera control: use your mouse to drag, currently I don't allow zoomingxw

not implemented:
-vdb(? not sure if this is necessary) because no such thing for webgl, not able to implement in a short period

extra features:
-no

-code structures:
main entrance is html, webgl contents initiate in canvas; main functions are in js folder;

-note:
currently I define "neighbor" as all particles in the cell where the investigated particle placed; the reason is strictly linear run time with easy implementation.

the O(M) method mentioned in class is alittle bit difficult to implement within a short time period; I eventually give up on that for the time being, will implement later; while the naive O(N2) method is just not the option for webgl so those are the main reasons I decide go with my current solution.
