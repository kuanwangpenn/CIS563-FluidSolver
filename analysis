-peak average fps			-first peak fps converging time
9.11(without zsort)					13 seconds(experienced a drop of fps)

9.7(zsort)							mono increasing

9.7(zsort insertion)				mono increasing



overall the observed results have a very small diff;
I am not sure if I did algorithm wrong, which I think it should be correct.

an explanation could be JIT compiler is continuously optimize the js code so all of these 3 methods will eventually give a very similar results;
but as we can see, zsort is approaching to the peak fps value faster.
